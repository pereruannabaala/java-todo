# Java Task Manager Project

This is a simple **Java project** managed with **Gradle**. It uses **JUnit 5** for testing and comes with the **Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`)** so you don’t need to install Gradle manually.

---

## What is `gradlew`?

The `gradlew` (Gradle Wrapper) script ensures that the project always uses a **specific version of Gradle**, regardless of what is installed on your system.

-  Consistency: Everyone uses the same Gradle version.  
-  Convenience: No need to install Gradle separately.  
-  Portability: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.  

Files related to the wrapper (and already in this repo):
- `gradlew` (Linux/macOS script)
- `gradlew.bat` (Windows script)
- `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`
- `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`
